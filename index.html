          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to understand why
          there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
          created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
          course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
          special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
          swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
          instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
          the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
          and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR
          REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
          double box around it. Sign up for Science Times We’ll bring you
          stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the
          cosmos. SIGN UP On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio
          astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang,
          and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
          right. Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
          cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
          led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
          Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
          gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched
          violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a
          trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun
          evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that
          Dr. Guth was correct.
